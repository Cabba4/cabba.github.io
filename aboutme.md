title: About me
subtitle: and why did I bother to make the writeups?
---

My name is Anmol Arora, and I am currently working at [Kalmar](https://www.kalmar.fi/) as a DevOps engineer. I am also pursuing my master's in Information Security at Tampere University. During my freshman year in my bachelor's program (Software Engineering at TAMK), I took a class on Introduction to Cyber Security. Soon after, I realized that this field is far more interesting to me than frontend or web app development!

I completed my bachelor's degree and graduated in May 2024 with my thesis: [Ansible and Jenkins based solution for managing Virtual Machine pools](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/856001). I chose Ansible as the technology for my thesis because of its versatility and ease of use, making it ideal for my DevOps role at Kalmar.

Currently, I am trying to find my work-life balance while exploring and learning about hardware hacking. At university, I am taking courses on Cryptography, Security Protocols, Cloud Computing, and more.

The writeups here are a way for me to store my progress on different challenges and present them in a decently moderated way. I enjoy reading other writeups and comparing them to mine to understand the thought processes of other fellow hackers.

I am also working to expand this space beyond just challenges I solve, including reviews and progress updates as I learn new things.

I describe myself as a lifelong learner who is always curious and eager to try something new.

## What else do you need?

Apart from this, I like to cook, play volleyball regularly, and hunt for cybersecurity-related job openings. :DThat's all about me. Feel free to shoot me a message if you think I am worth your time!

PS - I use cabba as my online name/presence because I am a huge Dragon Ball fan and cabba was introduced around the time when I started this blog/site :)
