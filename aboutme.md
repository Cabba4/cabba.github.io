title: About me
subtitle: and why did I bother to make the writeups?
---

My name is Anmol Arora and I am a software engineering student at the Tampere University of Applied Sciences with a particular interest in the field of Cyber Security. In my freshmen year I took a class on Introduction to Cyber Security and soon after I realised that this is much more interesting to me than going through frontend, web-app stuff :)

So thus I started my journey and so far I here are my nerdy stats 

- TryHackMe top 4% 
- HackTheBox Script Kiddie
- Defend the Web 50% completion
- PortSwigger - 23% done
- Regular participant in every CTF possible

Apart from these I have gone through introductory stuff like overthewire for developing my linux terminal skills. I also have keen interest in binary analysis and reverse engineering but I am far too inexperienced there(yet). I like to spend my weekends going through CTFs and sometimes even bug hunting methodologies.
The writeups here are a way for me to store my progress on different challenges and also present them in a decently moderate way. I like to read other writeups and then compare them from my own so I can understand the thought process of other fellow _hackers_

## What else do you need?

Apart from this I like to cook and go for outdoor sports and hunt for cyber-security related job openings :D
Thats all about me feel free to shoot me a message if you think I am worth the time!
